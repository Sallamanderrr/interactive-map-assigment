The assignment involves creating a program with two main components: a graph data structure (ListGraph and Edge classes) for representing a network of places and connections, and an application that utilizes this structure to allow users to interact with a map. 
Users can define places on the map, establish connections between these places, and find paths between selected locations. The application includes functionalities like adding new places, connecting places, showing and modifying connections, and finding paths, along with a GUI component for user interaction.
